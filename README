- The client starts a workflow.
The Workflow API defines the steps and logic.
QStash orchestrates execution by triggering each step and passing results between them.
Each step runs independently and reports its result back before the next step starts


Step-by-step flow
1. Client → Workflow API
The Client sends initial data to the Workflow API.
This could be an HTTP request like “start this workflow with these inputs”.

2. Workflow API → QStash
The Workflow API forwards the same initial data to QStash.
QStash is responsible for starting and coordinating the workflow execution.
Think of QStash as the traffic controller.

3. QStash starts the workflow
QStash triggers Step 1 by calling the Workflow API.
It passes the initial data to Step 1.

4. Step 1 executes
Step 1 runs its logic (e.g., calling a service, processing data).
When it finishes successfully:
It returns step 1 results back to QStash.
The step is marked SUCCESS.
